				INTRODUCTION

		<p>
			Depression (known formally as Major Depressive Disorder), is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think, and how you act. It can lead to a multitude of physical and emotional struggles that can hinder an individual's ability to work, function, and enjoy life.
		</p>
		<p>
			Though depression is fortunately treatable, the political environment now is not making it any easier for those affected to have easy access to health. On top of that, the current social environment of many countries has changed little to accommodate and accept those with mental disorders, instead reinforcing a stigma that make those affected reluctant to reach out, open up to others, and seek help.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are a handful of mental health applications available as mobile applications with website counterparts, but there are few mobile or desktop platforms that are directly geared toward suicide prevention.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>TalkToMe</strong> is a site that functions primarily on a mobile platform, designed specifically to be used during the moments when an individual is seriously considering suicide. The primary intention of the site is to divert the user from an irreversible course of action, and not for long-term usage like many other apps are made for.
		</p>
		<p> 
			The questions presented on the site will be carried forward in a very straightforward, simple fashion. These prompts will be delivered in a “forced help” method, in other words, in a slightly forceful manner. This is in order to counter the “learned helplessness” that coexists with depression. Due to lacking accessible help, people with depression may find it hard to take initiative to continue searching for a better option, so the site will take some of the responsibility of the users’ hands in order to follow through with actions such as going through with a call to a suicide hotline, or reaching out to nearby mental health professionals.

				<p>
					The first couple of panels are a space for the user to vent on a platform without the danger of posting or sending something unwanted. Considering the state of mind of a suicidal individual, it is crucial to start with panels that allow the user to express their emotions instead of letting them boil inside. This venting is also meant to distract the user from their motive of death, to reconsidering their emotions.

						The first panel is a venting bubble to allow the user to project their thoughts right off the bat. This simulates the action of writing a message to a friend, without requiring the hesitation of sending a loaded message. By writing out one’s thoughts, the hope is to be able to take a moment to center oneself in writing.

						The second panel is an extension of the first panel to let the user express their emotions, this time in regards to family, friends, and loved ones. Due to the stigma of mental illness, a worrisome amount of depressed individuals often keep details about their mental health a secret.

						Depressed individuals may be genuinely surprised to know that, though not always obvious, their loved ones would like nothing more than to have the knowledge to help and care for them. This panel subtly brings attention the care and love that surrounds an user, despite the extreme hopelessness of a moment that makes that seems impossible.

					This may be one of the hardest things for a depressed individual to accept, but is also one of the most cliché phrases regarding being depressed. It is included in this site because it is immensely important acknowledge that people with depression are not alone in their pain, are fiercely involved with their own unique emotions, but have people around them wanting to support them through it.

						“You’re not alone.” is faded in separately to emphasize it. The rest appears a second later to validate the user’s individual experiences, as sometimes saying that one is not alone means that they are easily understood by others, and that their experiences are common and standard. This is not true, and needs to be made clear.

						This panel has an embedded feature that allows the user to send an automated message asking for help to any of their contacts. The message is a simple one that does not embellish, and made to simplify the user’s course to asking for help among people who know them. Writing and sending a message in an emotional situation is often hard to do, so this panel consolidates that motion of getting help into a single button that brings the user to their frequent contacts page.

						Suicide hotlines are extremely important and the people behind the phone are great anonymous listeners for a potential user who needs or wants a person to talk to. Though this site is designed to function like a suicide hotline, it is important to offer all possible resources while engaging the user, to maximise amount of help. This panel will also not show the next button to the next panel unless the user calls the number or saves it to their contacts.

					The rest of the panels on the site function more to support the user in a long-term viewpoint, but providing immediate information for the user to reach out as soon as possible. Many of these panels are designed to not allow skipping without writing in the text boxes or saving information to one’s phone. These very much reflect the <strong>forced help</strong> method that this site employs in order to push the user as close to help as possible, to counteract the <strong>learned helplessness</strong> that characterises many experiences with depression.

			<strong>TalkToMe</strong> would be hosted at the domain <strong>Ifeelreallyshitty.com</strong>, an unused domain. Making a brand name seems impractical given the emergency nature of the website, rather making it something someone who would, in desperate attempt to vent, type into a search bar. However, giving it a general site name such as <strong>TalkToMe</strong> states the nature and intent of this site very clearly, and gives the site another label for potentials users to search and find.
		</p>
		<p> 
			Ideally, this site would be easily accessible from major social networking site as a safety net for users, as well as making its presence prevalent to all those who may need it. Even if forgotten, if the site is prevalent on major social sites, there is a chance of this site’s name being incorporated into the subconscious memory of those social site users. Thus, these users may type out a sentence in the form of the website url if in a precarious situation to need the site.

			Fundamentally and superficially, the site would employ an atmospheric simple design to engage the user, and specifically direct a course of questions that would tease out the user’s objective voice, and farther away from an extreme suicidal mindset. Deep blue tones of the chosen image are used specifically to induce calmer feelings, and a simple serif font is used to mimic the default text of digital documents or social media fonts to keep an aura of familiarity instead of decoration.

				EFFECTS

		</div>
		<p>
			The usage of this site would ideally divert suicidal individuals from ending their lives from being overwhelmed by extreme despair and hopelessness. The site would guide users through panels that will allow them to express themselves as fully as thoroughly as needed, and give them multiple resources to directly reach out to and save to their devices.
		</p>
		<p>

			However, it is important to note that this site only deals with immediate suicide situations, changing only the local mindset of a user. There needs to be more of an evolution of societies around the world to accept mental illness, so that people can feel supported and honest with the people around them. It is crucial to validate the experiences of those struggling with mental illness, and counteract those struggles efficiently and effectively, with acceptance, tolerance, love, and care.
